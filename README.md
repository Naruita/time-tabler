# Time Tabler
###### Time Tabler is still being prototyped.
Time Tabler is an open-source scheduler, notification service, and a deployment service for applications.
Mostly made just so that I don't skip classes and get a notification in time.

## Features to be added
Essentially, the features that Time Tabler can be used for are,
- Setting up a time table for each day - time, course, links required.
- A notification service 15 minutes prior to your class beginning.
- Starting up all the websites (applications might come later) a few minutes prior to the class starting.
